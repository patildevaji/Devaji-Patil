# Devaji-Patil
I am currently pursuing bachelor of engineering in electrical and electronics field and majoring in Power systems with the ability to analyze complex problems, evaluate and recommend alternatives and a desire of using renewable energy to its full extent in the automotive industry. During this period I have hands-on experience in Matlab, AutoCAD, battery management system and renewable energy sources. Apart from that, I have hobbies of solving puzzles, reading blogs and outdoor sports. Furthermore, I make a priority of studying the latest industry trends and best practices, ensuring that I and my team are bringing the most current standards to the corporate world. Whatever I am today is because of my parents and teachers.  I am always striving to give 100 percent to the work that I do. I have worked with Microsoft club in our college and currently, I am serving as secretary in the IEEE Executive committee. I excelled in classes as well and never lost sight of the practicality of an employable degree. I have encouraged my teammates to aspire to use the discipline learned through sports to life skills.
